# Serial Bridge

Python serial bridge connecting Arduino devices to KUKSA Databroker and Pullpiri.

## Overview

This bridge reads input from Arduino devices and:
1. Sends joystick button state to KUKSA Databroker and drives the LED Arduino (GREEN on press, OFF on release)
2. Sends YAML artifacts to Pullpiri based on the gear (rotary encoder) button input

## Build

Built via docker compose from the `serial-bridge` directory (image `serial-bridge:latest`):

```bash
cd ..
docker compose build
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DATABROKER_IP` | `resiso-databroker` | KUKSA Databroker hostname/IP |
| `DATABROKER_PORT` | `55555` | KUKSA Databroker port |
| `MASTER_IP` | `127.0.0.1` | Pullpiri apiserver host (single node; the compose file may override it) |

## Serial Ports

| Port | Device | Direction |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `/dev/arduino_joystick` | Joystick button | Input |
| `/dev/arduino_led` | NeoPixel LED | Output |
| `/dev/arduino_gear` | Rotary encoder button | Input |

## Data Flow

### Joystick → KUKSA + LED

1. Button press detected → Queue message `True`
2. Thread-DB sends to DataBroker: `Vehicle.Cabin.ResourceIsolation.ButtonPressed=True`
3. Main thread sends `GREEN\n` to LED Arduino
4. Button release → Same flow with `False` and `OFF\n`

### Rotary Encoder → Pullpiri

The gear Arduino sends a single digit over serial when its button is pressed at a
rotation position. The `Thread-Gear` worker maps it to a workload YAML and posts
it to Pullpiri. A repeated value for the current mode is ignored.

| Gear input | Mode | Action | YAML sent |
|------------|------|--------|-----------|
| `1` | HIGH LOAD (Timpani) | Launch the LED workloads | `/yaml/container-launch.yaml` |
| `0` | LOW LOAD (Normal) | Stop the LED workloads | `/yaml/container-stop.yaml` |

## YAML Artifacts

Located in `/yaml/` directory (mounted volume):
- `container-launch.yaml` - Sent when gear input is `1` (HIGH LOAD / LAUNCH)
- `container-stop.yaml` - Sent when gear input is `0` (LOW LOAD / STOP)
